<p>Active Tables is a web web application with the following hierarchical structure of pages (tables): Accounts => Profiles => Campaigns, which renders tables obtained from a fake API that simulates the backend. </p>

<p>On the table page, we have the table name, a filter and pagination buttons. On the pages of the second nest and deeper, there is also a "Back to" button, clicking on which allows you to return to the previous page. Tables have a sorting function, when you click on the top row of the corresponding column, sorting occurs by ascending or descending, which is indicated by the triangular indicator on the right side of the corresponding row. When you click on one of the lines, the transition to the selected entity is made according to the structure. The filter allows you to filter the contents of the table according to the entered characters</p>

<p>During the creation of this project, the following technologies were used: Typescript, React, Vite</p>
